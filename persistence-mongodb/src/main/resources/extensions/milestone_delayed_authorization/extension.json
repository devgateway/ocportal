    "en": "M&E reports for Makueni need a delayed option for reporting it as Milestone. This delayed milestone status is not available and the status codelist is closed. We have added a boolean property to the milestone, delayed that can be set to true. Reports also contain an `authorizePayment` field, which shows if the report recommends proceeding with the actual payment. This is too a boolean property"
