jOCDS - The Java Open Contracting Data Standard Validator

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/devgateway/jocds/jocds/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/devgateway/jocds/jocds/_latestVersion)

OCE is a project that allows importing the public procurement data, available in the common MS Excel format,
into a native Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS) NoSQL storage, and then run visual data analytics
(display a live dashboard with charts, maps and data tables as well as custom comparison charts).
Since the data is natively stored in the OCDS format, it can be readily exported in this format without any transformation required, and with great throughput.
