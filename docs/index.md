The Open Contracting Portal (OC Portal) is an open-source platform built to organize and archive procurement documents, 
improve data transparency and feedback by the public, and to help publish procurement information in the [Open Contracting Data Standard (OCDS)](https://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/). 

[DG](https://developmentgateway.org/) developed the platform using the Open Contracting Explorer (OCE) framework upon 
which several of our OC tools are built, and the [DG Toolkit](https://github.com/devgateway/dg-toolkit), 
which is a flexible, customizable, and ready-to-launch set of code modules that DG developed and often uses as a ‘base’ from which we build new systems.
