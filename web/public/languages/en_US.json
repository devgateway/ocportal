  "crd:indicators:i180:shortDescription": "Supplier receives multiple single-source/non-competitive contracts from a single procuring entity during a calendar year",
  "crd:landing:introduction:1": "The Corruption Risk Dashboard (CRD) is an open source tool that aims to help users understand the potential presence of corruption in public contracting. Through a red flagging approach (highlighting procurement activities that have certain risk factors), this dashboard explores corruption risk through the visualization of indicators that are mapped to three different forms of corruption: fraud, collusion, and process rigging.",
  "crd:landing:intendedUse:title": "Intended Use",
  "crd:landing:intendedUse:introduction": "The CRD was designed with the primary objective of supporting two specific use cases:",
  "crd:landing:intendedUse:introduction:1": "1. To facilitate the efforts of procurement regulators and informed observers to identify individual contracts that may warrant investigation, and;",
  "crd:landing:intendedUse:introduction:2": "2. To aid these individuals to monitor corruption risk in procurement markets over time. ",
  "crd:landing:distinguishing:title": "Distinguishing between &ldquo;Corruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;Corruption Risk&rdquo;",
  "crd:landing:distinguishing:1": "While flags associated with a procurement process may indicate the possibility that corruption has taken place, they may also be attributable to poor data quality, systemic weaknesses, or practices that may be appropriate when specifically authorized by a procurement authority or regulatory institution. For this reason, this tool is best viewed as a mechanism for identifying the “risk” of corruption, rather than “corruption” itself. ",
  "crd:landing:distinguishing:2": "Furthermore, in some instances, a single flag - such as for the awarding of two contracts to the same supplier by a single procuring entity - may not show any evidence of wrongdoing, though the confluence of multiple indicators suggests greater cause of concern. ",
